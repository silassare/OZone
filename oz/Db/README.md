## Db Types Directives
 - Only basic types defined in SQL should be supported
 - Enum, Set, and customs types of MySQL and Co should not be supported
 - Before adding new types we should be sure that:
   - the type is defined and supported by SQL Server
   - the type is well supported by all/majors RDBMS
   - we could change RDBMS without pains
